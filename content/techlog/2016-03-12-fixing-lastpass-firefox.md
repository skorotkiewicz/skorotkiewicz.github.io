If you are having problems with your browser locking up whenever youâ€™re entering a password perform the following change.  
Click the LastPass icon in your browser, and select preferences.  
Then click on Notifications in the left hand menu.  
Finally un-select the "Click Icons in Fields" option.  
The interactive bits in the fields seems to be the core cause of the browser slow down / hangs.
