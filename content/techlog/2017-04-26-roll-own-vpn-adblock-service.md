It's actually super cheap & easy. The setup below costs a few dollars a year and uses ~20MB RAM total:

- Get a VPN Provider
- Install OpenVPN & setup client certs with [https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install](https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install)
- Setup your hosts file with [http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.txt](http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.txt)
