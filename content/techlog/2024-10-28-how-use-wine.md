1. Configure Wine for 64-bit Architecture

   Set Wine to 64-bit mode and specify a custom Wine prefix directory:

```
export WINEARCH=win64
export WINEPREFIX=~/.wine64.ableton
mkdir -p "$WINEPREFIX"
```

2. Run Wine Configuration

   Launch Wine and select Windows 7 as the operating system:

```
wine64 winecfg
```

3. Navigate to Wine Directory

   Move into your designated Wine directory:

```
cd "$WINEPREFIX"
```

4. Install Required Libraries

   Use winetricks to install all necessary libraries:

```
pacman -S winetricks

winetricks gdiplus msxml3 msxml4 msxml6 vcrun2005 quicktime72 fontsmooth=rgb msls31 d3dcompiler_43 corefonts atmlib
```

5. Download and Install Ableton Live

   Download Ableton Live and extract the installer. Once extracted, navigate to the installer folder and run the setup:

```
export WINEARCH=win64
export WINEPREFIX=~/.wine64.ableton
wine64 Ableton\ Live\ 11\ Suite\ Installer.exe
```

6. Running Ableton Live

   After installation, to start Ableton Live, use `explorer.exe`:

```
export WINEARCH=win64
export WINEPREFIX=~/.wine64.ableton
wine64 explorer.exe
```

Then, navigate to `'C:\ProgramData\Ableton\Live 11 Suite\Program\Ableton Live 11 Suite.exe'`:

    My Computer
    C Drive
    ProgramData
    Ableton
    Live 11 Suite
    Program
    Double-click on Ableton Live 11 Suite.exe

This should provide a streamlined, professional setup guide for running Ableton Live with Wine in a 64-bit configuration.
