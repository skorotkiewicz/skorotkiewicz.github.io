# 5 Bizarre Programming Languages

If you think programming languages are just about semicolons and curly braces, think again! There are some truly unique and bizarre programming languages out there. In this post, we'll explore five of them, along with their quirky "Hello World" examples.

## 1. Brainfuck

Brainfuck is a minimalist and esoteric programming language. It uses only eight commands and operates on a simple memory model. Here's a "Hello World" program in Brainfuck:

```
++++++++[>++++[>++>+++>+++>+<<<<-]>+>+>->>+[<]<-]>>.>---.+++++++..+++.>>.<-.<.+++.------.--------.>>+.>++.
```

## 2. Intercal

Intercal, short for "Compiler Language with No Pronounceable Acronym," is intentionally designed to be as confusing as possible. Here's how you write "Hello World" in Intercal:

```
DO ,1 <- #13
PLEASE DO ,1 SUB #1 <- #238
DO ,1 SUB #2 <- #108
DO ,1 SUB #3 <- #112
DO ,1 SUB #4 <- #0
DO ,1 SUB #5 <- #64
DO ,1 SUB #6 <- #194
DO ,1 SUB #7 <- #48
PLEASE DO ,1 SUB #8 <- #22
DO ,1 SUB #9 <- #248
DO ,1 SUB #10 <- #168
DO ,1 SUB #11 <- #24
DO ,1 SUB #12 <- #16
DO ,1 SUB #13 <- #162
PLEASE READ OUT ,1
PLEASE GIVE UP
```

## 3. Whitespace

Whitespace is a programming language that ignores all non-whitespace characters. It's all about, well, spaces and tabs! Here's the "Hello World" program:

```


```

## 4. CodeGolf

CodeGolf is a competitive programming language, where the goal is to write the shortest possible code to accomplish a task. A simple "Hello World" in CodeGolf might look like this:

```
"Hello, World!"
```

## 5. Velato

Velato is a language based on musical notation. To print "Hello World" in Velato, you would use musical notes, like this:

```
C D E F G A B H C
```

These languages may not be practical for real-world development, but they certainly showcase the creative and quirky side of programming. Whether you're interested in minimalism, absurdity, or even music, these languages have something unique to offer. Have fun exploring the world of unconventional programming languages! ðŸš€
