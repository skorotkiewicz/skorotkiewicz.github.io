Today a lot has changed on my blog, the biggest change is the migration from **Jekyll** to **Hugo**.

From now on my previous website and blog are integrated into one whole unit.

I also added small features, such as [tags (with fancy CloudTag)](/tags/) ^\_^, [categories](/categories/) or even an [archive](/#archive) that clearly shows how many posts I have made in one month :)

The blog is still open source, if you want you can watch my swears at [github.com/skorotkiewicz/skorotkiewicz.github.io](https://github.com/skorotkiewicz/skorotkiewicz.github.io).

My old archived blog: [github.com/skorotkiewicz/techlog](https://github.com/skorotkiewicz/techlog).
