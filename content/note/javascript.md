I've always programmed in PHP, but a year ago a school friend asked me to help him with a program written in javascript, I immediately wrote him a program in php, but he intrigued me with javascript and since then I started using javascript! Today thanks to my friend I am programming in React and NodeJS and I think JavaScript is the best programming language <3

Today I am at a fairly high level in React and NodeJS...

Thanks Victor ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)!
