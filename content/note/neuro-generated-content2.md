# Neuro-Generated Content: Legal Framework Proposal

## Definition

**Neuro-Generated Content (NGC)** refers to creative works produced through the interpretation and transformation of human neural signals (EEG, fMRI, or other brain-computer interface data) by artificial intelligence systems.

Unlike purely AI-generated content, NGC explicitly recognizes the human brain as an active co-creator in the generative process, establishing a hybrid authorship model.

---

## Key Principles

### 1. Dual Authorship Recognition
NGC operates under a **collaborative creation model** where:
- The **Human Subject** provides neural input reflecting cognitive, emotional, or creative states
- The **AI System** interprets and transforms these signals into tangible creative output
- Both parties are recognized as essential contributors to the final work

### 2. Neural Data Sovereignty
- Neural signals are classified as **biometric data** with heightened privacy protections
- The originating human retains fundamental rights over their brain data
- Any commercial use requires explicit, informed consent
- Right to deletion and data portability applies (GDPR-compliant)

### 3. Default Rights Distribution

**Standard NGC License (50/50 Model)**:
- **Human Subject**: 50% intellectual property rights
- **Technology Provider**: 50% intellectual property rights
  - Divided among: Hardware manufacturer, AI model developer, decoding algorithm creator (negotiable)

**Alternative Models**:
- Parties may negotiate different splits (e.g., 70/30, 60/40)
- Non-commercial use may grant 100% rights to human subject
- Educational/research contexts may have separate frameworks

---

## Categories of NGC

### Type I: Passive Neural Recording
- Content generated from unconscious brain states (e.g., dreams, meditation)
- Lower intentionality, higher interpretive role of AI
- **Suggested split**: 40% human / 60% technology

### Type II: Active Neural Creation
- Content generated from conscious, directed thought (e.g., imagining specific scenes)
- Higher intentionality, AI serves more as translator
- **Suggested split**: 60% human / 40% technology

### Type III: Collaborative Neural-AI Interaction
- Real-time feedback loop between human thought and AI output
- Iterative creative process with both parties actively shaping result
- **Suggested split**: 50% human / 50% technology (default)

## Rights and Obligations

### Human Subject Rights:
✓ Right to be identified as co-creator  
✓ Right to approve commercial use  
✓ Right to veto publication/distribution  
✓ Right to access raw neural data  
✓ Right to delete neural data  
✓ Right to negotiate profit-sharing terms  
✓ Protection against misrepresentation of neural states  

### Technology Provider Rights:
✓ Right to be credited for technological contribution  
✓ Right to fair compensation for infrastructure/development  
✓ Right to anonymize and aggregate data for research (with consent)  
✓ Right to refuse processing of harmful/illegal content  

### Mutual Obligations:
- Transparent disclosure of data processing methods
- Clear documentation of contribution percentages
- Honest representation of creative process
- Respect for ethical boundaries in neural data use

---

## Commercial Framework

### Revenue Sharing
For commercially exploited NGC works:
1. **Gross revenue** is calculated after platform fees
2. Rights holders receive proportional share based on agreed split
3. Minimum thresholds may apply for micro-transactions

### Derivative Works
- Any derivative work requires consent from all original rights holders
- Derivative creators gain rights only to new additions
- Original NGC rights remain with initial creators

### Licensing Models
- **Personal Use License**: Free, non-commercial use by human subject
- **Research License**: Reduced fees for academic/scientific purposes
- **Commercial License**: Full rights negotiation required
- **Open NGC License**: Human subject may choose to release under open terms (CC BY, etc.)

---

## Ethical Safeguards

### Prohibited Uses:
- Creating NGC from non-consenting individuals
- Misrepresenting neural states or mental conditions
- Exploiting vulnerable populations (minors, impaired individuals)
- Using NGC for surveillance or manipulation
- Generating harmful content from neural data

### Consent Requirements:
- **Informed Consent**: Clear explanation of technology, process, and rights
- **Ongoing Consent**: Right to withdraw at any stage (pre-publication)
- **Specific Consent**: Separate approval for each commercial use case
- **Capacity Assessment**: Verification of mental capacity to consent

### Data Protection:
- Neural data classified as **sensitive biometric information**
- Encryption required for storage and transmission
- Retention limits (deletion after agreed period)
- Prohibition on selling raw neural data to third parties

---

## Dispute Resolution

### Ownership Disputes:
1. **Mediation**: Preferred first step with neutral NGC specialist
2. **Arbitration**: Binding arbitration if mediation fails
3. **Court**: Litigation as last resort (specialized IP courts)

### Valuation Disputes:
- Independent assessment of contribution percentages
- Consideration of technological investment vs. creative input
- Market value analysis for profit-sharing disagreements

---

## International Considerations

### Harmonization Goals:
- Push for international treaty recognizing NGC as distinct category
- Cross-border enforcement of NGC rights
- Mutual recognition of NGC licenses

### Regional Variations:
- **EU**: Strong data protection, human-centric rights emphasis
- **US**: More flexible commercial frameworks, innovation-focused
- **Asia**: Varying approaches, potential for distinct NGC models

---

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Recognition (Years 1-2)
- Legal recognition of NGC as distinct from AI-generated content
- Basic framework for consent and data protection
- Industry standards development

### Phase 2: Standardization (Years 3-5)
- Standardized licensing agreements
- Dispute resolution mechanisms
- Registry for NGC works and rights holders

### Phase 3: Maturation (Years 5+)
- International treaties and harmonization
- Established case law and precedents
- Evolution based on technological advances

## Open Questions for Legal Evolution

1. **How to handle group neural sessions?** (Multiple people's EEG data combined)
2. **What about post-mortem rights?** (Using deceased person's archived neural data)
3. **How to address neural "deepfakes"?** (Simulating someone's neural patterns)
4. **Should there be a "neural fair use" doctrine?**
5. **How to balance research needs with privacy rights?**

---

## Conclusion

Neuro-Generated Content represents a paradigm shift in creative authorship, requiring new legal frameworks that respect both human cognitive sovereignty and technological innovation. This proposal establishes foundational principles for fair, ethical, and sustainable NGC practices.

**This framework prioritizes**:
- Human dignity and neural privacy
- Fair compensation for all contributors  
- Innovation and creative freedom
- Ethical boundaries in brain-technology interfaces
