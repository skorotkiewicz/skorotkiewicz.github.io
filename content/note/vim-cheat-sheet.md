# A Great Vim Cheat Sheet

## Essentials

### Cursor movement (Normal/Visual Mode)

- `h` `j` `k` `l` - Arrow keys
- `w` / `b` - Next/previous word
- `W` / `B` - Next/previous word (space seperated)
- `e` / `ge` - Next/previous end of word
- `0` / `$` - Start/End of line
- `^` - First non-blank character of line (same as `0w`)

### Editing text

- `i` / `a` - Start insert mode at/after cursor
- `I` / `A` - Start insert mode at the beginning/end of the line
- `o` / `O` - Add blank line below/above current line
- `Esc` or `Ctrl+[` - Exit insert mode
- `d` - Delete
- `dd` - Delete line
- `c` - Delete, then start insert mode
- `cc` - Delete line, then start insert mode

### Operators

Operators also work in Visual Mode

- `d` - Deletes from the cursor to the movement location
- `c` - Deletes from the cursor to the movement location, then starts insert mode
- `y` - Copy from the cursor to the movement location
- `>` - Indent one level
- `<` - Unindent one level

You can also combine operators with motions. Ex: `d$` deletes from the cursor to the end of the line.

### Marking text (visual mode)

- `v` - Start visual mode
- `V` - Start linewise visual mode
- `Ctrl+v` - Start visual block mode
- `Esc` or `Ctrl+[` - Exit visual mode

### Clipboard

- `yy` - Yank (copy) a line
- `p` - Paste after cursor
- `P` - Paste before cursor
- `dd` - Delete (cut) a line
- `x` - Delete (cut) current character
- `X` - Delete (cut) previous character
- `d` / `c` - By default, these copy the deleted text

### Exiting

- `:w` - Write (save) the file, but don’t quit
- `:wq` - Write (save) and quit
- `:q` - Quit (fails if anything has changed)
- `:q!` - Quit and throw away changes
- `:qa` - Quit all windows
- `:wqa` - Write and quit all windows

### Search/Replace

- `/pattern` - Search for pattern
- `?pattern` - Search backward for pattern
- `n` - Repeat search in same direction
- `N` - Repeat search in opposite direction
- `:%s/old/new/g` - Replace all old with new throughout file (gn is better though)
- `:%s/old/new/gc` - Replace all old with new throughout file with confirmations

### General

- `u` - Undo
- `Ctrl+r` - Redo

## Advanced

### Cursor movement

- `Ctrl+d` - Move down half a page
- `Ctrl+u` - Move up half a page
- `}` - Go forward by paragraph (the next blank line)
- `{` - Go backward by paragraph (the next blank line)
- `gg` - Go to the top of the page
- `G` - Go the bottom of the page
- `: [num] [enter]` - Go to that line in the document
- `number + j / k` - Go to line relative line number, down or up
- `ctrl+e / ctrl+y` - Scroll down/up one line

### Character search

- `f [char]` - Move forward to the given char
- `F [char]` - Move backward to the given char
- `t [char]` - Move forward to before the given char
- `T [char]` - Move backward to before the given char
- `;` / `,` - Repeat search forwards/backwards

### Editing text

- `J` - Join line below to the current one
- `r [char]` - Replace a single character with the specified char (does not use Insert mode)

### Visual mode

- `O` - Move to other corner of block
- `o` - Move to other end of marked area

### File Tabs

- `:e filename` - Edit a file
- `:tabe` - Make a new tab
- `gt` - Go to the next tab
- `gT` - Go to the previous tab
- `:vsp` - Vertically split windows
- `ctrl+ws` - Split windows horizontally
- `ctrl+wv` - Split windows vertically
- `ctrl+ww` - Switch between windows
- `ctrl+wq` - Quit a window

- `:vs|:te` or `:vs+te` - Vertical split with new term
- `:sp+te` - Horizontal split with term

### Marks

- Marks allow you to jump to designated points in your code.
  - `m{a-z}` - Set mark {a-z} at cursor position

* A capital mark {A-Z} sets a global mark and will work between files
  - `'{a-z}` - Move the cursor to the start of the line where the mark was set
  - `''` - Go back to the previous jump location

### Text Objects

Say you have `def (arg1, arg2, arg3)`, where your cursor is somewhere in the middle of the parenthesis.

- `di(` deletes everything between the parenthesis. That says “change everything inside the nearest parenthesis”. Without text objects, you would need to do `T(dt)`.

General

- `.` - Repeat last command
- `Ctrl+r + 0` in insert mode inserts the last yanked text (or in command mode)
- `gv` - reselect (select last selected block of text, from visual mode)
- `%` - jumps between matching `()` or `{}`

## My tweeks:

```vim
" Alt+,/.
nnoremap <M-,> :tabprevious<CR>
nnoremap <M-.> :tabnext<CR>

" shift+alt+j/k | duplicate selectec line down/up
nnoremap <S-M-j> :t.<CR>
nnoremap <S-M-k> :t-<CR>

" alt+j/k move selection down/up
nnoremap <A-j> :m .+1<CR>
nnoremap <A-k> :m .-2<CR>
```
