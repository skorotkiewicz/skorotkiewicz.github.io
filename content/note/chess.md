**Do you like to play chess?** I learned exactly on _December 31, 2019_, at a friend's New Year's Eve party. Since then, there's not a day I don't play chess.

My favorite site to play online chess is [lichess.org](https://lichess.org/), free and no ads. Where I can easily analyze games and learn from my mistakes, just like with chess tasks I can train my skills continuously, or with the help of studies written by other users.

I recommend everyone to start playing chess, the rules are very simple and it's a lot of fun! :)
