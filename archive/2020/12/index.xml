From now on my previous website and blog are integrated into one whole unit.
I also added small features, such as tags (with fancy CloudTag) ^_^, categories or even an archive that clearly shows how many posts I have made in a given month :)
The blog is still open source, if you want you can watch my swears at github.</description></item></channel></rss>
