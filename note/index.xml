I learned exactly on December 31, 2019, at a friend&amp;rsquo;s New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve party. Since then, there&amp;rsquo;s not a day I don&amp;rsquo;t play chess.
My favorite site to play online chess is lichess.org, free and no ads. Where I can easily analyze games and learn from my mistakes, just like with chess tasks I can train my skills continuously, or with the help of studies written by other users.</description></item><item><title>Convert all FLAC music collection to Apple Lossless (ALAC)</title><link>https://skorotkiewicz.github.io/note/flac-to-alac/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2021 19:46:33 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://skorotkiewicz.github.io/note/flac-to-alac/</guid><description>It preserve the metadata by itself.

From now on my previous website and blog are integrated into one whole unit.
I also added small features, such as tags (with fancy CloudTag) ^_^, categories or even an archive that clearly shows how many posts I have made in one month :)
The blog is still open source, if you want you can watch my swears at github.</description></item></channel></rss>
