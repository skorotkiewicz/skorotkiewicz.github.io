This unique type of ice is designed to remain solid until it comes into contact with water, providing a refreshing cooling effect without the usual mess of melted ice.
What is Intelligent Ice? Intelligent Ice is engineered to start melting only when it interacts with liquid, making it ideal for keeping drinks chilled without diluting them too quickly.</description></item></channel></rss>
